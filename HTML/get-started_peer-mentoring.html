			<p class="article-tagline crimson"><strong>Do you have questions about conducting research as an undergraduate?</strong> <span class="has-gray-text">Ask experts who are undergraduates themselves!</span></p>
			<p>Our peer mentors, who are currently working on their own research projects, have made themselves available to answer your questions about the research process. They have the <strong>experience and training</strong> to answer questions such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>&#8220;How do I get started with my research?&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;Will I get paid to work on research, or am I eligible for a special scholarship?&#8221;</li>
				<li>&#8220;How do I find a faculty mentor who will oversee and guide my work and training?&#8221;</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>How to Meet with a Peer Mentor</h2>
			<p><strong>We use the cloud-based online scheduling software Setmore to enable you to arrange your own meeting with a peer mentor.</strong> After selecting how long of a meeting you want and which mentor to meet with, you can view that mentor&#8217;s availability and choose a time slot that works best for you. You will need to sign in to confirm and book the final appointment, and you can either create a Setmore account or sign in with Facebook or Google.</p>
