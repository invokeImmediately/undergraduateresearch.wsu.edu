<p><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>The Washington State University Office of Undergraduate Research has announced that scholarships have been awarded to 27 students pursuing research with a mentor in the coming 2018-19 academic year.</p>
<p>Each student received either a Carson or an Auvil award to support research, scholarly activity, or creative projects that advance or create new knowledge in a specific field.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Our ability to support students in their research is made possible thanks to generous donors who envision the contributions these students will make in the future to Washington, the U.S., and beyond,” said Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research. The office is part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>“Receiving an Auvil or Carson scholarship helps to lessen students’ financial burdens, so they can better focus on new discoveries in their fields.”</p>
<p>All award recipients are required to present results of their work on posters at the eighth annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA). That event is set for March 25, 2019 in the Compton Union Building.</p>
<h3 class="h4-text-size">Carson Fellows for 2018-19</h3>
<p>The Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Endowed Excellence Fund, established in 2013, supports researchers as they progress in their careers. The Carson’s, WSU alumni, have supported the university with their service and numerous financial gifts for many years. The Carson award is the first to give preference to student researchers who are in their junior and senior years.</p>
<p>This year’s award recipients and their majors and mentors are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Elise Bugge, environmental and ecosystem sciences, mentored by Dave Evans</li>
	<li>Nam Nguyen, marketing and international business, mentored by Chad Gotch</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h4-text-size">Carson Fellows for 2018-19</h3>
