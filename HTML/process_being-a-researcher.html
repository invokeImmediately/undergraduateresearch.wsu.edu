<h1>Being a Researcher</h1>
<h2>Tips for Success</h2>
<img class="autoScaledTo90 shiftToCenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2015/05/Graphic_Being-a-Researcher.jpg" />
<h2 class="fancy with-top-border">Adopt the Right Mindset</h2>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Keep your enthusiasm</h3>
<p class="oue-normal">The attiutudes of <strong>open-mindendess</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong>, <strong>self-discipline</strong>, and <strong>enthusiastic persistence</strong> are required to successfully perform research work. And maintaining those attitudes takes purposeful effort. Because <strong>research involves a quest for new knowledge</strong>, you're going to be working on projects that deal with questions which don’t necessarily have an answer&mdash;or we're not sure yet what the answer is, which is why we’re working on it in the first place. So you need to <strong>be prepared to work on open-ended projects</strong>. It's entirely possible that you will go down some dead ends, but if so, don't fret. That is part of the process of discovery that all researchers go through; remind yourself of this fact when the going gets tough.</p>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Remember: You Are a "Student First"</h3>
<p class="oue-normal">You need to remember that being a student researcher is just that: you are a student and a researcher. The student part cannot be diminished&mdash;<strong>your advisor should expect you to be working hard on classes, earning good grades, and making steady progress toward obtaining your degree</strong>. These goals are vital to <strong>properly balancing a successful undergraduate research experience</strong>. What good would it do you to accumulate research experience at the cost of jeaporadizing your obtainment of the academic degrees that are essential credentials for your future research career?</p>
<p class="oue-normal">That being said, we have found that students working in an active research group sometimes show improvements in GPA, and sometimes decreases in GPA; there’s no one “right” way to balance your research activities with coursework, but keep in mind the balancing of your priorities is all part of the learning experience. In fact, the balanacing act you will learn to accomplish is integral to the entire research profession at all of its stages.</p>
<h2 class="fancy with-top-border">Adopt the Right Habits</h2>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Become Adept at Time Management</h3>
<p class="oue-normal">The <strong>importance</strong> of possessing <strong>superior time-management skills</strong> to leading a successful research career cannot be overstated&mdasg;and as an undergraduate researcher, now is the time to start cultivating those skills. <strong>Research uniquely juxtaposes the open-eneded with the time-sensitive.</strong> Scientific experiments have to be meticulously planned and prepared ahead of time, and then executed with efficient, dextrous, and undistracted precision. Multi million dollar research grants are planned and proposed two to five years in advance and then faithfully carried out. How do researchers manage these impressive feats of time management? The answer is found in the mundane but critical personal habits of periodic goal setting, daily task scheduling, routine task prioritization, and regular accountability for how one's time is spent.</p>
<h3 class="fancy with-top-border">Maintain Excellent Records</h3>
<p class="oue-normal"><strong>To be useful, knowledge must be shared&mdash;</strong>and that means you will eventually have to convince other experts in your field that the discoveries you made and the methods you used during your research are reliable. This implies the <strong>need to keep complete and accurate records</strong> of what you did, how you did it, and what you learned from doing it as you work on your research from day to day. So don't try to reinvent the wheel on record-keeping&mdash;as soon as possible, find out from the research experts who have gone before you what the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3943904/" target="_blank" title="Best Practices for Individuals, Group Readers, and Institutions" alt="Best Practices for Individuals, Group Readers, and Institutions">best ways are to to keep solid research records</a>.</p>
