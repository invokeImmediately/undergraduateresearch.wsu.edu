			<p class="article-tagline crimson"><strong>Scholarships for the academic year are available to students in all majors on all campuses.</strong> <span class="has-gray-text">Students can accept a scholarship for one or two semesters.</span></p>
			<p>Applications for the next set of all awards are <strong>due March 5, 2021 </strong>(faculty mentor endorsements are <strong>due March 9, 2021)</strong>; successful applicants will receive those awards for the following academic year starting in August, 2021. Preference will be given to first-time applicants and students early in their academic career. Applicants are not expected to have research experience at the time of application.</p>
			<p>Successful recipients are required to present their research at WSU&#8217;s annual <a href="https://surca.wsu.edu">Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (SURCA)</a>*. It is part of WSU Showcase Week, and is held in spring semester in Pullman; in 2021, SURCA will be virtual due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions.</p>
			<p>Our online application for these awards opens for submissions late in the fall semester before the deadline. The application requires students to enter personal statements and brief descriptions of intended or current research, scholarship, or creative activity. Once each application is submitted, an email will automatically be sent to each applicant&#8217;s specified WSU research mentor requesting a required letter of recommendation or endorsement. (The student&#8217;s mentor is the person who will oversee the research during the period of the scholarship.)</p>
			<p><span class="has-smaller-text"><em>*Students graduating in December may still present their research at the spring SURCA, but they will not be eligible for awards. Students who have already left the Pullman area will be asked to submit a report of their accomplishments during the award period in lieu of a SURCA presentation.</em></span></p>

				<p><a class="dy--block flt--left mb--500mx mr--750mx mt--250mx non-text-link w--25pct" title="Biography of Grady &amp; Lillie Auvil" href="http://waef.org/grady-auvil-lillie-auvil/"><img class="w--100pct" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2015/05/Portrait_Auvil-Awards.jpg" alt="Portraight photo of Grady &amp; Lillie Auvil" /></a> This award supports research, scholarship, and creative activity for undergraduate students in all majors, all campuses, and at all levels of undergraduate education.</p>
				<p>This fund was created by a 2006 gift from the estates of <a title="Biography of Grady &amp; Lillie Auvil" href="http://waef.org/grady-auvil-lillie-auvil/"><strong class="fw--semi-bold">Grady and Lillie Auvil</strong></a>, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Grady Auvil believed in the importance of education and research. He was instrumental in establishing the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission in 1968, and his work introduced many new fruits and innovations beneficial to growers. Throughout his life, he and his wife contributed generously to the WSU community, and this fund serves as a continuation of that legacy.</p>
				<p>Hundreds of WSU undergraduates have received funding from this award and become Auvil Fellows.</p>

				<p><img class="dy--block flt--left mb--500mx mr--750mx mt--250mx non-text-link w--25pct" src="/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2015/05/Portrait_Scott-and-Linda-Carson.jpg" alt="Portraight photo of Scott &amp; Linda Carson" /> The <strong class="fw--semi-bold">Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Endowed Excellence Fund</strong> was created in 2013 by the Carsons, WSU alumni who have supported the university generously with their service and financial gifts. Recipients of awards from this endowment are known as Carson Fellows. The Carson Fund is the first university-wide undergraduate research fund that gives preference to recipients who are upper-division students (juniors and seniors).</p>

				<h3 class="gray-darker-text">Team Mentoring Program (TMP) Research&nbsp;Awards</h3>
				<p><img class="dy--block flt--left mb--500mx mr--750mx mt--250mx non-text-link w--25pct" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/51/2020/11/wsu-tmp-logo_361w349h.png" alt="Logo of the WSU Team Mentoring Program: Building connections for Success!" /> The <strong>Team Mentoring Program Research Awards</strong> are sponsored by the Washington Research Foundation and The Boeing Co. This program is designed to maximize the experience of students pursing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and pre-health majors, and to increase their retention, achievement, graduation, and preparation for post-baccalaureate endeavors. Undergraduate research experience can play a pivotal role in students&#8217; educational and career development. These awards can encourage and support students served by the TMP in accessing such opportunities and, consequently, help to transform their educational experience and bridge the access gap for underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM-related fields. Since 2009, dozens of WSU URM students have received funding from these awards and become TMP Scholars. Please <a href="https://tmp.wsu.edu">visit the TMP website</a> to learn more.</p>

				<p><img class="dy--block flt--left mb--500mx mr--750mx mt--250mx non-text-link w--25pct" src="https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/51/2020/08/art_undergraduate-research-in-action_1114x1114px-96x96.jpg" alt="A faculty mentor points at a result in an undergraduate researcher's laboratory notebook." />Thanks to the generosity of donors to the Undergraduate Research Development Fund, the Office of Undergraduate Research can make awards to a wide variety of students pursuing research. These general awards from this office&#8211;part of the Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement&#8211;have supported students across the university for a number of years. In 2020 donations from our generous donors allowed us to double the number of awards being made as well as increase the size of our awards. These awards also help students who otherwise need to work so they can reduce their work commitments and engage in opportunities like undergraduate research. Recipients of these awards are called Undergraduate Research Fellows.</p>
				<p>If you would like to support undergraduate research please <a href="/give/#ugr-development-fund">visit our <i>Support Us</i> page</a>, which contains detailed instructions for giving to the fund.</p>
