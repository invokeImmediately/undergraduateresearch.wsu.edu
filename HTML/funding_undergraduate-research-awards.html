    <p>This fund was created by a 2006 gift from the estates of <a href="http://waef.org/grady-auvil-lillie-auvil/" target="_blank" title="Biography of Grady & Lillie Auvil" alt="Biography of Grady & Lillie Auvil"><strong>Grady and Lillie Auvil</strong></a>, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Grady Auvil believed in the importance of education and research. He was instrumental in establishing the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission in 1968, and his work introduced many new fruits and innovations beneficial to growers. Throughout his life, he and his wife contributed generously to the WSU community, and this fund serves as a continuation of that legacy.</p>
    <p>More than 200 WSU undergraduates have received funding from this award and become Auvil Fellows.</p>
