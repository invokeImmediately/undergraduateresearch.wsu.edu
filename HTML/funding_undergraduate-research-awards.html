			<p class="article-tagline crimson"><strong>Scholarships for the academic year are available to students in all majors on all campuses.</strong> <span class="has-gray-text">Students can accept a scholarship for one or two semesters.</span></p>
			<p>Applications for all awards are due annually in early spring with awards made for the following academic year.</p>
			<p>Preference will be given to first-time applicants and students early in their academic career. Applicants are not expected to have research experience at the time of application.</p>
			<p>Successful applicants will present their research at WSU&#8217;s annual <a href="https://surca.wsu.edu">Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity (SURCA)</a>*.</p>
			<p>Our online application for these awards opens for submissions starting late in the fall semester. The application requires the student to enter a personal statement and a brief description of their intended research, scholarship, or creative activity. Once the application is submitted, an email will automatically be sent to the student&#8217;s specified WSU research mentor to request a required letter of recommendation. (The student&#8217;s mentor is the person who will oversee the research during the period of the scholarship.)</p>
			<p><span class="has-smaller-text"><em>*Students graduating in December may still present their research at the spring SURCA, but they will not be eligible for awards. Students who have already left the Pullman area will be asked to submit a report of their accomplishments during the award period in lieu of SURCA presentation.</em></span></p>

				<p>This fund was created by a 2006 gift from the estates of <a title="Biography of Grady &amp; Lillie Auvil" href="http://waef.org/grady-auvil-lillie-auvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Grady and Lillie Auvil</strong></a>, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Grady Auvil believed in the importance of education and research. He was instrumental in establishing the Washington Tree Fruit Research Commission in 1968, and his work introduced many new fruits and innovations beneficial to growers. Throughout his life, he and his wife contributed generously to the WSU community, and this fund serves as a continuation of that legacy.</p>
				<p>More than 200 WSU undergraduates have received funding from this award and become Auvil Fellows.</p>
