			<p>The opportunity to present your research or creative work to experts in your discipline is exciting. In fact, sharing or disseminating the new knowledge you’ve created in your field is essential to the research or creative process. Sharing your work creates the chance for you to network with professionals.  It’s also a meaningful accomplishment to add to your resume or vita.  However, <strong>traveling to a conference costs money. There are funding sources available to help cover your costs</strong> and  the information on this page will help guide you through steps to find funding, and help prepare you for that professional presentation experience.

			<p>The Office of Undergraduate Research funds travel awards on a competitive basis to qualified students in all majors on the Pullman campus to partially cover the costs of presentation outside of WSU. Disbursement of travel awards from our office is contingent upon actually presenting at a conference. <strong>Travel awards range from $300-600 per student, and it is expected that the student’s mentor, department, or college will also commit support for the student’s travel.</strong> Applications are accepted year-round; but they must be received at least six (6) weeks before the start date of the conference where you will present. <em>It is our expectation that your expenses will be 100% covered, but you will need to find multiple sources of money to cover all of your expenses. (See <a href="#planning-a-budget">Planning a Budget</a>, below.)</em></p>
			<h3 class="h6-fs tt--none"><span id="when-to-apply" class="anchor-wrapper">When Should I Apply for Travel Awards?</span></h3>
			<h4 class="fs--1200mx">For Office of Undergraduate Research Awards</h4>
			<p>The earlier you apply, the better. We prefer to receive applications a minimum of six (6) weeks before your anticipated travel to the event.</p>
			<h4 class="fs--1200mx">For External Travel Awards</h4>
			<p>Many conferences and meetings have travel awards for students. Check your meetings website early in the process for deadlines and applications. It is expected that you will apply for a conference or meeting travel award when such an award is available.</p>

			<h3 class="h6-fs tt--none"><span id="additional-funding" class="anchor-wrapper">Ideas for Additional Funding</span></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Conference</strong>: Check the conference website to see if <em>travel awards</em> are offered to students and, if so, apply for one! You might also be able to volunteer to help at the meeting for a discount—be sure to ask. You can also trim costs if the conference offers a <em>reduced registration fee</em> for students as well as <em>early-bird registration rates</em> if you register before a certain date.</li>
				<li><strong>Mentor</strong>: Ask your research mentor for support. They might have funds, and they can also help by requesting funds from the department chair or college dean, or organizations in their discipline.</li>
				<li><strong>Your Department and College</strong>: Many department chairs and college deans have access to money donated to support students; this funding can likely be used for travel costs associated with presenting at a meeting.</li>
				<li><strong><a href="https://honors.wsu.edu/">Honors College</a></strong>: If you are a student in the WSU Honors College, check with that office about possible financial travel support.</li>
				<li><strong>PNW LSAMP/TMP/McNair/etc.</strong>: If you are eligible or affiliated with certain programs at WSU (such as the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (<a href="https://vcea.wsu.edu/lsamp/">LSAMP</a>), the Team Mentoring Program (<a href="https://tmp.wsu.edu/">TMP</a>), the <a href="https://mcnair.wsu.edu/">McNair Scholars program</a>, and others) ask the advisor about possible travel assistance.</li>
				<li><strong>The <a href="https://www.cur.org/">Council for Undergraduate Research (CUR)</a>:</strong> A national and non-profit organization, CUR promotes undergraduate research for students in all majors; CUR awards are available to STEM and non-STEM students. Various disciplines within CUR provide travel awards to students, such as biology, psychology, and social sciences.  Also, <a href="https://www.cur.org/trimmer_travel_fund/">CUR&#8217;s Trimmer Travel Award</a> is specifically designed to fund an Arts &amp; Humanities student&#8217;s travel to the World Congress on Undergraduate Research. You can find and explore CUR application details <em>by discipline</em> using the <a href="https://www.cur.org/search/?q=travel%20awards">search tool on the CUR website</a>.</li>
				<li><strong>Discipline-specific organizations:</strong> If you know the names of such organizations, check websites. Also, ask your mentor for ideas.</li>

				<li><strong>Keep in touch</strong>: Notify us at <a href="mailto:ug.research@wsu.edu">ug.research@wsu.edu</a> with updates and details, such as when you secure additional funding or when anticipated costs change. <span class="text-decoration: line-through">Funding sources like us want to know how you are doing toward reaching your budget needs!</span></li>

			<h4 class="fs--1100mx">My abstract was accepted! And I received a travel award from your office. What are your expectations of me?</h4>
			<p><strong>Before the conference:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Once you have been notified of acceptance to present at the conference, you must forward the official notification from the conference to <a href="mailto:ug.research@wsu.edu">ug.research@wsu.edu</a>. <strong>We will not allocate or release funds to cover your expenses until our office receives such documentation.</strong></li>
				<li>Be aware that you may need to cover travel costs up front with your own funds until you return to campus and turn them in for reimbursement. So, determine how you want to pay for expenses while traveling. For many meetings, WSU rules allow us to pay registration and air travel up front, but other expenses are covered by you and reimbursed after the meeting.  <strong>Note:</strong> Many hotels place significant holds on payment accounts (especially debit cards), which can unexpectedly reduce the amount available from such an account (such holds can encumber available funds for a few weeks). Check with your mentor to determine what payment method will be right for you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>After the conference:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>After you have attended the conference, you will be required to type a personal thank-you letter to the person who (or organization that) funded your award. We will provide you with instructions for writing a strong, meaningful letter. It must be typed and hand-signed, among other requirements. You will submit this thank-you letter to the Office of Undergraduate Research; we will make sure the appropriate person receives it.</li>
				<li>In the spring following your conference, you will be expected to present your research at the Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA). We will check to be sure you have <a href="https://surca.wsu.edu/">submitted your abstract</a> by the SURCA abstract deadline.</li>
				<li>You will also be required to submit receipts and such for your conference-related expenses. Details about reimbursement procedures will be communicated to you.</li>

			<h3 class="h6-fs tt--none"><span id="final-preparations" class="anchor-wrapper">Prepare for the Conference</span></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Work with your faculty mentor to prepare your presentation.</li>
				<li>Practice any presentation you expect to deliver.</li>
				<li>If you are presenting a poster, make sure to submit it for printing well in advance of your travel date and double check it days before you leave. This will leave you with adequate time to handle unforeseen problems.</li>
				<li>Look at the conference agenda and identify workshops or sessions that you plan to attend. Some conferences are very large and there are many concurrent sessions. Ask you mentor for suggestions of what to attend.</li>
				<li>Refresh your resume with all of your latest relevant information or accomplishments, and prepare a few copies to take with you.</li>
				<li>Make sure your class material will be covered while you are gone.  If necessary, arrange to take exams at your conference or meeting.</li>
				<li>Start a draft thank-you letter to send to your supporters following the conference.</li>
				<li>Plan your travel wardrobe and pack a few days before you leave for the conference.</li>
				<li>Organize important documents and travel information; share your itinerary and contact information with your mentor as well as family and friends.</li>
				<li>Remember to take your poster, violin, artwork, or whatever you need to deliver your presentation!</li>
				<li>Throughout your trip, keep careful receipts as well as written records of your travel expenses.</li>
