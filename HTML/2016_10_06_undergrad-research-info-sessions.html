<p>Everyone is welcome at the free sessions which are both <strong>scheduled from 5:00-6:00 p.m.</strong> on those days, <strong>in room 405 of the Smith Center</strong> for Undergraduate Education. No registration is required.</p><!--more-->
<p>Pressley said that her office, which includes a team of students who are as peer mentors, serves students in all majors and grades. In addition to information and mentoring, it sponsors the annual spring Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities—SURCA—a poster session featuring the research, scholarship, and creative pursuits of hundreds of students who are mentored by faculty at campuses across the state as well as the Global Campus.</p>
<p>“I believe that interest in undergraduate research is increasing among students, and our program gives students information and tools they can use to get started and locate a faculty mentor,” said Pressley.</p>
<p>Questions to be answered at the information sessions will include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>“What is undergraduate research and how do I get started?”</li>
	<li>“Is all research done in laboratories?”</li>
	<li>“How do I connect with a research mentor?”</li>
	<li>“Can I talk to a peer mentor or another student who is already doing their own research?”</li>
</ul>
