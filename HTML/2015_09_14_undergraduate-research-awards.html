<p><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>Twenty- nine Washington State University students at Pullman, Vancouver, and Tri-Cities campuses have received three types of awards from the Office of Undergraduate Research, part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>“These industrious students will work with faculty mentors throughout the 2015-16 academic year on research and creative projects, advancing or creating new knowledge in a specific field,” said Shelley Pressley, undergraduate research director. “On March 28, they will share their results, along with about 150 other students, at the fifth annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA),” said Pressley.</p><!--more-->
<h4>Gifts since 2006 fund one-third of a million dollars in awards</h4>
<p> “Supporting student research aligns with a key focus of our land-grant university. The three types of awards made so far this year are typically $1,000 each. They bring the total amount of our awards made since the Office of Undergraduate Research began in 2006 to around one-third of a million dollars. We are grateful for our generous alumni and friends whose gifts have enriched the academic experience of hundreds of students.”</p>
<p>The Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Endowed Excellence Fund is the newest award, established in 2013. The Carson’s are WSU alumni who have supported the university with their service and numerous financial gifts. The Carson Fund is the first to give preference to recipients who are upper- division students (juniors and seniors).</p>
<p>The Fuentes- Kirk award was created in 2012 by Norma C. Fuentes and Gary M. Kirk, supporters of the Office of Undergraduate Education. Their award was created to support students pursuing research with a mentor.</p>
<p>The first undergraduate research award fund in the Office of Undergraduate Research — the Auvil Scholars Fellowship — began in 2006 with a gift from the estates of Grady and Lillie Auvil, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Auvil awards are available to undergraduate researchers from all majors, in all grades, across all WSU campuses.</p>
