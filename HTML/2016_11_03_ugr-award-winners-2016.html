<p><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>Twenty-five Washington State University students at Pullman, Tri-Cities, and Vancouver have received two types of awards from the Office of Undergraduate Research, part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>These students will work with faculty mentors throughout the 2016-17 academic year on research, scholarly, and creative projects, advancing or creating new knowledge in a specific field, said Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research.</p><!--more-->
<p>“Each award is typically $1,000 and helps to ease financial stress so awardees can focus more on their research,” said Pressley “We are fortunate to have generous alumni and friends whose gifts have enhanced the academic experience of hundreds of students.”</p>
<p>She said, “Supporting undergraduates in their research aligns with our land-grant university’s key emphases. Awardees will share their results at the sixth annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA) on March 27, 2017.”</p>
<h4>Carson and Auvil awards</h4>
<p>The Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Endowed Excellence Fund was established in 2013. The Carson’s are WSU alumni who have supported the university with their service and numerous financials gifts. The Carson award is the first to give preference to student researchers who are in their junior and senior grades.</p>
<p>The Auvil Scholars Fellowship began in 2006 with a gift from the estates of Grady and Lillie Auvil, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. These awards are available to undergraduate researchers from all majors, in all grades, across all WSU campuses. More than 200 WSU undergraduates have received this award since its beginning and become Auvil Fellows.</p>
