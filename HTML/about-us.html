			<p><span class="article-tagline">Our mission is to <strong class="crimson-text">promote transformational student learning</strong> by encouraging, supporting, and celebrating undergraduate participation in research, scholarship, and creative activities.</span> To achieve this mission, we conduct programs and events that facilitate research opportunities and experiences for WSU undergraduates in all majors and class levels.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Office of Undergraduate Research helps WSU undergraduate students get started in research through the work of our <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/peer-mentors/">peer mentors</a> and the insights taught in our <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/peer-mentors/"><em>Introduction to Directed Research</em> course</a>.</li>
				<li>We provide two annual, singular opportunities for students to share their research with the university community and beyond. These opportunities include the spring <a href="https://surca.wsu.edu/">Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities</a> and <a href="https://summerresearch.wsu.edu/poster-symposium/">Summer Research symposium</a>.</li>
				<li>Our office tangibly encourages our students to share their work nationally and internationally at professional conferences and meetings through our <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/funding/travel-awards/">travel awards</a>.</li>
				<li>We materially support student research through the <a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/funding/undergraduate-research-awards/">awarding of Undergraduate Research scholarships</a>.</li>
				<li>Our staff supports the efforts of faculty to secure research funding, including the submission of <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/">Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site proposals</a> to the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Office of Undergraduate Research is part of the <a href="https://provost.wsu.edu/daesa">Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement (DAESA)</a>. DAESA is located in, and supported by, the <a href="https://provost.wsu.edu/">Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President</a>. DAESA operates under the direction of the <a href="https://vpue.wsu.edu/">Vice Provost for Academic Engagement and Student Achievement</a>.</p>
