			<h4>Key Components of Undergraduate Research</h4>
			<p>Undergraduate research in all majors and disciplines has four components.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Originality:</strong> Projects should involve a meaningful contribution to the discipline.</li>
				<li><strong>Mentorship:</strong> Efforts will be conducted with the guidance of an expert.</li>
				<li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Projects must use techniques or methods that are appropriate to the field of study.</li>
				<li><strong>Dissemination:</strong> Results produced are worthy of sharing with others so that collective knowledge can be advanced.</li>
			</ul>

		<div style="" class="column two ">
			<p>In <strong>Science</strong>, <strong>Technology</strong>, <strong>Engineering</strong>, and <strong>Mathematics</strong>, you might:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Put on a white coat and neoprene gloves before sequencing unknown genomes in a sterile laboratory.</li>
				<li>Get your hands dirty as you develop new methods of shaping metal parts for your aero-robot.</li>
				<li>Design new catalysts that enable you to burn renewable biodiesel in place of conventional diesel.</li>
				<li>Engineer a parallel computing platform based on GPUs to speed analysis of large biological data sets.</li>
