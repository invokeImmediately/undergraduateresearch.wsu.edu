			<p>It’s a fact…WSU has long been a leading U.S. research university. Today it&#8217;s working to become one of the top 25 by Year 2030, thanks to Pres. Kirk Schulz and the Drive to 25 initiative. Plus the strategic plan calls for involving more undergraduates in all types of research on campus.</p>
