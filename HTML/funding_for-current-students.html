<h2 class="fancy with-top-border">Research Funding for Current WSU Students</h2>
<p class="article-tagline alt">There are individuals and organizations who recognize the value and importance of undergraduate "research" (research, scholarship, and creative activities) and provide funding to promote it.</p>
<p>These funding sources can be used to support the work of WSU undergraduates whether they conduct their research at WSU or somewhere else.</p>
<h4>Funding at WSU</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Pursue <strong><a href="/funding/undergraduate-research-awards/">Undergraduate Research Awards</a></strong>, which are offered by the Office of Undergraduate Research. An application is required with a deadline in early spring, and students who are selected will receive funding during the next academic year. Awards are disbursed as part of your scholarship and financial aid package.</li>
	<li><strong>Ask your research mentor</strong> about funding. Many faculty have grant funds to support undergraduates.</li>
	<li><strong>Check with your department or college</strong> for research scholarships. For example:<ul>
		<li>The <a href="https://honors.wsu.edu/honors-scholarship-application/" target="_blank">Honors College</a> provides scholarships that specifically support students conducting research</li>
		<li>The <a href="https://adarp.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">Alcohol and Drug Abuse Research Program</a> in the College of Veterinary Medicine offers research fellowships for students working on substance abuse research projects.</li>
		<li>The <a href="http://www.wsgc.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">Washington NASA Space Grant Consortium</a> offers scholarships for students in science, engineering, or math.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Join a <strong>professional society</strong> and look for funding opportunities and scholarships offered to student members. Noteable examples include:<ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/awards/other/student.html" target="_blank">American Chemical Society</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.asbmb.org/careers/scholarshipsandawards/" target="_blank">American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://www.asm.org/index.php/find-funding" target="_blank">American Society for Microbiology</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.collegeart.org/opportunities/" target="_blank">College Art Association</a></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Apply for <strong><a href="https://distinguishedscholarships.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">distinguished scholarships</a></strong> that promote undergraduate research. Examples of such scholarships include <a href="https://distinguishedscholarships.wsu.edu/awards/goldwater/" target="_blank">Goldwater</a> and <a href="https://distinguishedscholarships.wsu.edu/awards/fulbright-uk/" target="_blank">Fulbright UK</a> awards.</li>
	<li>Look at <strong>organizations within WSU</strong> that provide undergraduate research funding, such as the <a href="https://mcnair.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">McNair Achievement Program</a>, the <a href="http://tmp.wsu.edu/" target="_blank">Team Mentoring Program (TMP)</a>, and the <a href="https://vcea.wsu.edu/lsamp/" target="_blank">Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP)</a>.</li>
</ul>
