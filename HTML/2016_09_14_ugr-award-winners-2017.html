<p><strong>PULLMAN, Wash.—</strong>Twenty-seven Washington State University students at Pullman and Vancouver have received two types of awards from the Office of Undergraduate Research, part of WSU Undergraduate Education.</p>
<p>Recipients of Carson and Auvil awards will work with faculty mentors throughout the 2017-18 academic year on research, scholarly, and creative projects, advancing or creating new knowledge in a specific field.</p>
<p>“Awards are typically $1,000 and help to ease financial stress, so students can focus more on their research,” said Shelley Pressley, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research. “We are fortunate to have generous alumni and friends whose gifts make these awards possible.”</p><!--more-->
<p>“Supporting undergraduates in their research also adds immeasurably to their educational experience at our top research university,” said Pressley. “Awardees will present their results at the seventh annual Showcase for Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (SURCA) on April 2, 2018.”</p>
<p>The Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Endowed Excellence Fund, established in 2013, supports researchers as they progress in their careers. The Carson’s, WSU alumni, have supported the university with their service and numerous financial gifts. The Carson award is the first to give preference to student researchers who are in their junior and senior years.</p>
<p>The Auvil Scholars Fellowship began in 2006 with a gift from the estates of Grady and Lillie Auvil, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Auvil awards are available to undergraduate researchers from all majors, in all grades, from any WSU campus. More than 200 WSU undergraduates have received this award and become Auvil Fellows.</p>
