				<p><strong>PULLMAN</strong>, Wash.—Washington State University students can apply online now through March 5, 2021 for a variety of awards to support their mentored research, scholarship, and creative activities in academic year 2021-22, said Mary Sanchez Lanier, assistant vice provost.</p>
				<p>“Thanks to the vision of generous donors and other funding, recipients of these awards—students from all majors and campuses—can afford to spend more time concentrating on their research efforts rather than having to work at a job,” she said.</p>
				<p><a href="https://undergraduateresearch.wsu.edu/funding/undergraduate-research-awards/">Five types of awards are available</a> this year. Two are presented by the Office of Undergraduate Research in the <a href="https://daesa.wsu.edu/">Division of Academic Engagement and Student Achievement</a>, one is from the <a href="https://vcea.wsu.edu/">Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture</a>, another is awarded by the <a href="https://lsamp.wsu.edu/">WSU LSAMP</a> (Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation) program, and the fifth from the <a href="https://tmp.wsu.edu/">Team Mentoring Program</a> (TMP).<span id="more-3908"></span></p>
				<h3>Applying is Easy</h3>
				<p>Applicants must provide information on their educational background and research. Their faculty mentor must endorse their application online by March 9, 2021.</p>
				<p>“The process is very easy for students, and mentors are eager to support their applications. We encourage all students to consider this opportunity,” said Sanchez Lanier.</p>
				<h3>Select from Five Awards</h3>
				<p>The application form asks applicants to select among the five awards, with the option to choose more than one.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Auvil Scholars Fellowship</strong> is for undergraduates in all majors, campuses, and years in college. This fund was created in 2006 from an estate gift by Grady and Lillie Auvil, Wenatchee tree-fruit entrepreneurs. Hundreds of undergraduates across WSU have received funding from this award and become Auvil Fellows during their baccalaureate program.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Scott and Linda Carson Undergraduate Research Excellence Award</strong> is the first university-wide undergraduate research award that gives preference to recipients who are upper-division students (juniors and seniors). The fund was created in 2013 by the Carson’s, WSU alumni who have long supported WSU with their service and financial gifts. </p>
				<p>The <strong>DeVlieg Foundation Award</strong> was established by a private tax-exempt charity to support sophomore and junior students in the WSU Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture who are pursuing research into renewable energy. Applicants must have a 3.0 GPA. Recipients of the award are known as DeVlieg Fellows.</p>
				<p><strong>WSL LSAMP Research Awards</strong> are for LSAMP program participants at Pullman who are pursuing a science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) discipline. The program serves students who are Native-Alaskan/Native American, African American/Black, Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and/or two or more races when combined with any of these previously stated races. Applicants must have an overall 3.0 or higher GPA. Working with a faculty mentor, they commit to a full academic year of working on a research project. Awardees are known as WSU LSAMP Research Fellows. WSU <a href="https://lsamp.wsu.edu/about-lsamp/">LSAMP is an NSF-sponsored program</a> for underrepresented minority (URM) students in STEM fields.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Team Mentoring Program Research Awards</strong> are <a href="https://tmp.wsu.edu/scholarships-grants/tmp-research-scholarships/">sponsored by the Washington Research Foundation and The Boeing Co.</a> This program is designed to maximize the experience of STEM students and pre-health majors, and to increase their retention, achievement, graduation, and preparation for post-baccalaureate endeavors. These awards can encourage and support students served by the TMP in accessing such opportunities and, consequently, help to transform their educational experience and bridge the access gap for URM students in STEM-related fields. Since 2009, dozens of students have received funding from these awards and become TMP Scholars.</p>

					<h2>About daniel.rieck</h2>
					<p>I earned my PhD in Chemical Engineering at WSU by studying the biophysical nature of the molecular signaling mechanisms that control how the heart pumps blood. During my PhD work, my interest in and affinity for computer science, systems modeling, and visual and written communication blossomed into a new direction toward web development. I now pursue my passion for solving problems of communication and design through programming, automation, analysis, and abstraction.</p>
